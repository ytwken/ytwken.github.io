# Digit classification website with data augmentation

This folder contains
- tjfs.html (main code for the web app, written in HTML)
- spinner.gif (gif animation used by tjfs)
- README.md (file explaining folder contents, does not contain code)
- model (folder for group1-shard1of1.bin and model.json files desribing neural network models trained using TensorFlow)

TensorFlow, HTML, TensorFlow.js code and web app deployment via GitHub is used and adapted with permission mainly from
